## Data Structure



### # What is Data Structure ?

  - The way to save data

  - Type : Martix, linear, Tree, Gragh

    â€”> this is just concept, 

    â€”> actual : memory

    

  - Abstraction 

    -  abstract the way to show and control data
    - how to use data , not how to implement

  - Efficiency : can make efficient algorithm with structured data

  - Reusability : data structure is modularized -> easy to use again
